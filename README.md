Raft Consensus Algorithm
=============================

### Overview ###
[Raft](https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/raft.pdf) is a consensus algorithm for managing the replicated log over a cluster of servers in a consistent state. This project is an implementation of the Replicated Key-Value Store on top of the Raft Consensus Protocol. This repository contains the assignments for the course "CS-733 Engineering the Cloud- Advanced Distributed Computing" offered at IIT Bombay.

### Project Structure ###
The project at its core has two parallels, one is the Raft side and other is the Key-Value Store. These parallels run as Go-routines and communicate among themselves via channel.
The complete description of the [Raft package can be found here.](https://godoc.org/github.com/pankajrandhe/cs733/assignment4/raft) 

### Execution Instructions ###
To build the project use following command.

`go get github.com/pankajrandhe/cs733/assignment4/`

To test the project execute the following command.

`go test github.com/pankajrandhe/cs733/assignment4  -v `

### Usage ###
Following are the commands which Key-Value store accepts from the client.

* SET command 

   `set <key> <exptime> <numbytes> [noreply]\r\n`

   `<value bytes>\r\n`

   Server responds with:

   `OK <version>\r\n`

* GET command

   `get <key>\r\n`

   Server responds with:

   `VALUE <numbytes>\r\n`

   `<value bytes>\r\n`

* GETM command

   `getm <key>\r\n`

   Server responds with:

   `VALUE <version> <exptime> <numbytes>\r\n`

   `<value bytes>\r\n`

* CAS command

   `cas <key> <exptime> <version> <numbytes> [noreply]\r\n`

   `<value bytes>\r\n`

   Server responds with:

   `OK <version>\r\n`

* DELETE command

   `delete <key>\r\n`

   Server responds with:

   `DELETED\r\n`

### BUGS ###
* The project has not yet been tested for the log-reapair test cases.
